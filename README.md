## Overview

The **Twilight's Blade** cult is summoning rares across the Twilight Highlands every 5 minutes. Kill all 18 for the [Two Minutes to Midnight](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=42300/two-minutes-to-midnight) achievement before the Midnight launch.

**Twilight Ascension Rares** removes the guesswork. See exactly which rare is up, what's coming next, and share locations with your group in one click.

> **Note**: Updated for the 5-minute respawn hotfix on Feb 28
