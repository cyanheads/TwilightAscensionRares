## Twilight Ascension Rares

The **Twilight's Blade** cult is summoning rares across the Twilight Highlands every 5 minutes — and you need to kill all 18 for the [Two Minutes to Midnight](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=42300/two-minutes-to-midnight) achievement before the Midnight launch.

**Twilight Ascension Rares** removes the guesswork. See exactly which rare is up, what's coming next, and share locations with your group in one click.

### The Rotation

All 18 rares spawn in a fixed order on a 90-minute cycle. The addon calculates your position in the cycle automatically based on your realm's clock.
